# LoL-Auto-Login
Automatic login for League of Legends.

# Known issues
* Logging into the Alpha Client sometimes causes an "Authentication Failed" error **or** fails to trigger the login button; Might be related to speed.
* Some users are reporting that the program is exiting before logging in. Not sure if a client update or a change I made triggered this.
